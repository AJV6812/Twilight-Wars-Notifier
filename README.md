If you are here to read the source code then good luck. I warned you that it wasn't readable and it isn't.
There are 2 main reasons for this, everything is in one file and the variable names aren't the best.
If I were you I would just read from line 458 onwards, that's the part that runs every 2 minutes so that's probably what people are most interested in. I've tried to comment it so you aren't completely confused but no guarantee
